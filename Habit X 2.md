[[HabitX Project Report]]
# **Brief about HabitX**
- We're trying to build a complete SaaS solution for schools and students to help them craft [[habits]] , [[Habit-Building]] / Habit - Enabling solution
- The main characteristic here's that the paying customer is the school and the students are the users (Main Users).
- The approach we take is the Dashboard approach as schools and parents would love to have plenty of data to play around with multiple indicators on the students performance.
- We're trying to gauge teacher's performance too - Schools have to have a meaningful indicator to track [[teacher performances]] too - on a macro-scale. Kinda like an appraisal indicator
- Teachers get to assign homework on their dashboard for students where the students get their homework added to their [[Daily Habit List]]
Let's figure out the basic user flow of the web app (**Student-Perspective**) ==FIRST TIME USER LOGIN==
- User logs in with the [[student email id]]
- Basic [[Problem-Focused-User-Questions]]
- In between when the user searches for a goal - it should show autocomplete suggestions
- A window with the processing mark reading something like Understanding your timelines, Tailor-Fitting Habits for your goals etc while these questions are used to generate a set of Habits for the student user.
- Then the [[Daily Habit List]] shows up
- In the daily habit list, the user should be able to add their own habits and also remove habits that they don't think are adept to them
- There would also be [[Homework]] assigned by the teacher that shows up with the daily habits too at the end of the list. ( Quirky Feature)
- Next is the Dashboard which should be linked to the page with the daily habit lists - where a backlink reading Dashboard is at the end of the page with an arrow
- The [[Student Dashboard]] should show the needed indicators that are there - detailed in the note attached
Let's talk about [[Teacher Dashboard]]
- The teacher dashboard is an integral component to get the teachers involved with the students
- Should show the cumulative growth of the class, Habit Growth, Homework/Assignment Assigner, Teacher's note - about the whole class - brief of the class - special cases - performance indicators
- Every student will be an assigner on the dashboard where the teacher can check 3/4 stats straight mirrored from the student's DB
- [[Homework assigner]] is another important feature - Where the teacher gets to assign homework/assignments for the students ( Eliminates most edtech use cases )
Let's go to the [[School Admin Dashboard]]
- The [[School Admin Dashboard]] is one of the most integral components - non advertised as it's the main USP of the whole product
- It's supposed to give a bird's eye 360 view on how the school's performing - various indicators could be habit adherence, assignment submissions, class-wise performance, teacher performance ( time spent, assignments assigned, monitoring etc)
- They want to keep tabs on what to improve and to fix
- A classwise AI generated note would be a quirky feature to have.
There goes the [[Super User Dashboard ]]
- This would have performance indicators with regards to every indicator used in the web app - downtime - uptime, Time spent on the app, no.of habits being generated, no. of goals being pursued, no. of classes operating - realtime
- This is for the company HabitX to look at data and have an overall understanding of how operations are performing
